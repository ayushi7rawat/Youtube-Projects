What is **Hacktoberfest**?:
==========================

Hacktoberfest is a month-long challenge. It happens every year in the month of October.

Hacktoberfest is open to everyone and it marks the celebration of Open Source. It's the biggest Open Source event that encourages newbies to participate in Open Source and create their 1st meaningful PR. Hacktoberfest encourages participation in giving back to the open-source community by completing pull requests, participating in events, and donating to open source projects. Also, all backgrounds and skills levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

Of course, to participate, you must have a GitHub account first. New to GitHub? Check out my GitHub Blog and Playlist to learn more.

How does it work?:
==========================
- Maintainers determine if their open-source projects participate.
- [Quality pull requests](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/qualitystandards) submitted on GitHub and GitLab are rewarded.
- [Engaged maintenance](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/maintainers) of Hacktoberfest tagged repositories are rewarded.

When can you join?:
==========================
Registrations are now open but you can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31 in any time-zone. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.
